<br>
1) Installing the inf file provided with this driver might cause a conflict when trying to use Ocean Optics Software. The current solution is to switch between the NI-VISA USB Driver and Ocean Optics USB Driver.
<br><br><b>Steps for switching:</b>
<ul>
<li>Right click My Computer and select Properties</li>
<li>Click on the Hardware Tab, and select Device Manager</li>
<li>Look for NI-VISA USB Devices and expand it</li>
<li>Click on the device and select the Driver Tab</li>
<li>Click Update Driver then "No,not this time" and Next</li>
<li>Select "Install from a list or specific location(Advanced) then Next</li>
<li>Select "Don't search. I will choose the driver to install" then Next</li>
<li>Select the driver you wish to use, and click Next</li>
<li>The USB Driver you selected will be installed</li>
</ul>

REV 1.3.1, 09/12/2011 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectra.vi - The merge errors function in the False case was connected in the wrong order.<br>
2) Query Wavelength Calibration Coefficient.vi - The merge errors function added to VI, so that errors on the conversion of strings from the instrument to a value are captured.<br>
<br>

Modified by: James Gass<br>
Change Submitted by: Shawn Shaw, Austin,TX.<br>

<br>
REV 1.3.3, 10/15/2013 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectral Waveform -Previously assigned pixels to calculate wavelength are now using optical pixels instead of all pixels.<br> 
2) Read Spectra -Black pixel information and optical pixels are separated to give better results for measurements. <br>

<br>
REV 1.4, 11/15/2013 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven, NI<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectra VI (per REV 1.3.2) was obsoleted to avoid possible backwards compatibility issues.<br>
2) Read Optical Spectrum (Read Spectra Rev 1.3.3) was renamed to avoid possible issues. <br>
3) Read Spectral Waveform and Examples Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Process Spectrum, Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Log Spectrum, and Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Acquire Continuous Waveform were updated to use Read Optical Spectrum. <br>

<br>
REV 1.4.1, 08/05/2014 <br>
Modified by: Xudong Yong, Shanghai, China<br>
Modifications:<br>
(1) Read Optical Spectrum - Modify the start and stop optical pixel values for case 4114 and 4130.<br>
(2) Modify some non-ASCII text issues.<br>
<br>
REV 1.4.2, 02/2016 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven, NI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;Updated to support All pixels and optical pixels<br>
<ol><li>New VIs<br>
Private\Spectrometer Data<br>
Private\CS String to Num Array<br>
Private\Store Spectrometer ID<br>
Public\Data\Read Spectrum - now displays all or optical pixels<br><br>
<li>Modifications:<br>
<ul> Initialize - Pixel Mode control added to allow users to select optical or all pixels</ul>
<ul>Read Spectral Waveform - all the Pixel related information has been moved to the Private VI Spectrometer Data.</ul>
<ul>Calculate Wavelength - Calculation is done a bit differently. The black pixel offset is now used to compensate for the start of the optical offset in nm.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;Number of Pixels previously used as the count terminal is now calculated from values from Ocean Optics Definitions array control in the Private VI Spectrometer Data.</ul>
<ul>Obsoleted - Read Optical Spectrum - for users who only want optical spectrum to be displayed and not dark or garbage pixels.</ul>
<ul>Examples - Updated to use the new Read Spectrum VI.<br> 
*	Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Process Spectrum.vi<br>
*	Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Log Spectrum.vi<br>
</ul>
</ol>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;Added .inf and .cat files for the Flame model<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;[Bug fix]<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;Nonlinearity Correction- bug fix: P(A) applied to <b>Spectrum by Pixels</b> - <b>Dark Spectrum</b>, then + to <b>Dark Spectrum</b>- Validated by customer.<br>      
 <br>
 REV 1.4.3, 02/2016 <br>
 <li>Modifications:<br>
 Calculate Wavelength - Calculation wiring was corrected stop pixel minus start pixel<br>
 Read Spectrum&nbsp;&nbsp; - changed the write buffer string constant display wired into VISA Write back to Hex<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;
 - mean function updated to median because if a bad/garbage pixel is present in the black pixels the correct result is displayed instead of generating an error.
 <br>
 REV 1.4.4, 02/2016 <br>
 <li>Modifications:<br>
 Calculate Wavelength - The wavelength given was incorrect, because the wrong offset was being added. Additional notes were added for clarification and the start and stop pixels in the unbundle were swapped for better readability.<br>
