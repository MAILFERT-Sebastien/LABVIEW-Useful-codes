[LABVIEW] DEVICE CONTROL


## Aim
Simple DAQ VIs to generate Digital or analog output signals triggered by a counter


## Trigger_DO
Generate DO signal triggered by a counter
The camera DO is delayed from the laser DOs to allow them to be set before acquisition

## Trigger_DO_AO
Generate DO and AO signals triggered by a counter
The camera DO is delayed from the laser DOs to allow them to be set before acquisition
